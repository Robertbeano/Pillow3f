Description: So far this is in it's first stage. I'll show you a simple script, but this isn't meant to be used quite yet. 
        I'm just uploading the very first version I have for my friend to help me work on it.
        
        from Pillow3f.Renderer import RenderPipeline
        
        a, b, c = [-2, 0, 1], [-4, 0, -1], [-3, 12, 0]
        shape1 = [a, b, c]
        a, b, c = [1, 0, 1], [-1, 0, -1], [0, 1.5, 0]
        shape2 = [a, b, c]
        
        Pipe = RenderPipeline(600, 800)
        Pipe.camera = [[0, 0, -20], [0, x*(45/5), 0]]
                
        Pipe.triangle(shape1, [[150, 75, 0, 255], [150, 75, 0, 255], [0, 75, 200, 255]])    
        Pipe.triangle(shape2, [[255, 0, 0, 128], [0, 255, 0, 255], [0, 0, 255, 255]])
                
        Pipe.save('png', 'C:/', 'newRendered_image%s' % x)
